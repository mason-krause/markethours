``markethours``: A python library for referencing and localizing US stock trading hours
========================================================================================

``markethours`` overview
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

We created market ``markethours`` and the markethours.info API because we couldn't
find other free tools for accessing stock trading hours, and we wanted to provide
this library to help others experiencing similar issues. 

``markethours`` features include:

* Reference stock trading hours by date
* Automatically localize to Eastern Standard Time
* Easily check whether market has opened or closed
* No user accounts needed

Installation

Example usage
--------------

.. code-block:: python

  from markethours import MarketHours


  def main():
    todays_hours = MarketHours()

    # Check if the market has opened
    print(todays_hours.market_has_opened())

    # Check if the market has closed
    print(todays_hours.market_has_closed())

    # Wait for the market to open
    todays_hours.wait_for_market_open()

    # See the number of seconds until open
    print(todays_hours.seconds_till_open())

    # Do something if there's less than a minute before
    # close. Something like this could be used in a loop
    if todays_hours.seconds_till_close() < 60:
      print('Hurry up!')

    # Show open, close, and current time in EST
    print(todays_hours.open)
    print(todays_hours.close)
    print(todays_hours.now_est())


  if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
